# `#`
This is how you add comments to the file.
Comments is the data that’s immediately after the `# ` piece of text. E.g. comments can be seen below.

`print “I could have code like this” # and this is a comment`

# `print “string”, 1 + 2`
You can add in mathematical operations, variables & more after adding a comma to the end of a string to print. E.g. This will print as `string 3`.

# Mathematical Operators
`+` : Add
`-` : Subtract
`/` : Divide
`%` : Modulo (remainder after division)
`*` : Multiply
`>` : Greater than
`<` : Lesser than
`>=` : Greater or Equal
`<=` : Less or Equal

# Floating Point numbers
If a decimal is not specified, Python will run an operation that rounds off numbers to the nearest whole number. If a decimal is required, the variable that’s outputting a decimal should have decimals attached to it. E.g 4.0 instead of 4

# `variable = value`
In Python, variables are assigned with the `=` operator.
The style preferred is to use `_` (underscores) instead of spaces.
E.g. the style in JS is `camelCase`.

# Formatting Strings
These are placeholder variables for string. The type of placeholder used assigns the formatting variable for each of these.

## `%d`
Used for numerical values, the D is for Decimals

## `%s`
Used for string values, outputs text strings

## `%r`
Used for raw values, will output values as they are with quotation marks.

# `%` After strings
The `%` (modulo) operator after a string enables the string to have variables after it.

# `"""` ... `"""`

Multiline strings, can print as many newline strings with this.

# `\escape`

`\` can be used for special escape sequences.

## `\n`
This sequence creates a newline.  
Traditionally known as the ASCII Linefeed command.

## `\\`
This is used to print the backslash character as an output.

## `\t`
Creates a tabbed space.

# `raw_input([prompt])`
Creates an input field to collect input from the user.
Safer than just asking for `input`

# `from` module `import` function
How to extend functionality of different python files.

## `from sys import argv`
`argv` is the module that can take parameters passed to the script & then assign them to variables within the application.
`script, first, second, third = argv`

# `open(filename, w/r)`
Opens a file given to the program.
The parameter after the comma defines the mode it’s opened in.
The `w` mode deletes the previous file before opening it.

## `file.read()`
Reads the contents of any files

## `file.truncate()`
Deletes the contents of any files. Not needed if using `w` mode.

## `file.write(var)`
Writes to the file with any variable assigned to it.

## `file.close()`
Closes the file from the script

# `def function(arg1, arg2):`
This is how functions are defined in Python.
Functions can take arguments for it using the brackets.
Everything inside a function must be inside a tabbed area, the end of the tabbed code indicates the function has ended.
